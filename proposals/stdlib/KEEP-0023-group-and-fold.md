# Group by key and fold each group simultaneously

* **Type**: Standard Library API proposal
* **Author**: Ilya Gorbunov
* **Status**: Implemented in Kotlin 1.1
* **Prototype**: Implemented
* **Discussion**: [KEEP-23](https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/issues/23)

## Summary

Introduce a function similar to `groupBy`, but folding values of each group on the fly.

## Similar API review

* Ceylon: [`Iterable.summarize`](http://modules.ceylon-lang.org/repo/1/ceylon/language/1.2.0/module-doc/api/Iterable.type.html#summarize).

## Description

The following extension for `Iterable` and iterable-like receivers is proposed:

```kotlin
public inline fun <T, K> Iterable<T>.groupingBy(
    crossinline keySelector: (T) -> K
): Grouping<T, K>
```

where `Grouping<T, K>` is an interface defined as following:

```kotlin
// A wrapper around a source of elements which could be iterated 
// with the `keySelector: (T) -> K` function attached to it.
interface Grouping<T, out K> {
    fun sourceIterator(): Iterator<T>
    fun keyOf(element: T): K
}
```

Provide the following extensions for `Grouping<T, K>`:

```kotlin
// Generic aggregation (fold or reduce)
// The most generic form of aggregation, that other overloads 
// delegate their implementation to.
public inline fun <T, K, R> Grouping<T, K>.aggregate(
        operation: (key: K, value: R?, element: T, first: Boolean) -> R
): Map<K, R>

public inline fun <T, K, R, M : MutableMap<in K, R>> Grouping<T, K>.aggregateTo(
        destination: M,
        operation: (key: K, accumulator: R?, element: T, first: Boolean) -> R
): M


// Key-parametrized fold
// Here the initial value and the operation depend on the key of a group.
public inline fun <T, K, R> Grouping<T, K>.fold(
        initialValueSelector: (key: K, element: T) -> R,
        operation: (key: K, accumulator: R, element: T) -> R
): Map<K, R>

public inline fun <T, K, R, M : MutableMap<in K, R>> Grouping<T, K>.foldTo(
        destination: M,
        initialValueSelector: (key: K, element: T) -> R,
        operation: (key: K, accumulator: R, element: T) -> R
): M


// Simplified fold
// The `initialValue` is a constant and the operation do not depend on the group key.
public inline fun <T, K, R> Grouping<T, K>.fold(
        initialValue: R,
        operation: (accumulator: R, element: T) -> R
): Map<K, R>

public inline fun <T, K, R, M : MutableMap<in K, R>> Grouping<T, K>.foldTo(
        destination: M,
        initialValue: R,
        operation: (accumulator: R, element: T) -> R
): M


// Reduce
public inline fun <S, T : S, K> Grouping<T, K>.reduce(
        operation: (key: K, accumulator: S, element: T) -> S
): Map<K, S>

public inline fun <S, T : S, K, M : MutableMap<in K, S>> Grouping<T, K>.reduceTo(
        destination: M,
        operation: (key: K, accumulator: S, element: T) -> S
): M


// Count
public fun <T, K> Grouping<T, K>.eachCount(): Map<K, Int>

public fun <T, K, M : MutableMap<in K, Int>> Grouping<T, K>.eachCountTo(destination: M): M


// SumBy
public inline fun <T, K> Grouping<T, K>.eachSumOf(
    valueSelector: (T) -> Int
): Map<K, Int>

public inline fun <T, K, M : MutableMap<in K, Int>> Grouping<T, K>.eachSumOfTo(
    destination: M, 
    valueSelector: (T) -> Int
): M

```

## Use cases

The most common use case is doing some aggregation, broken down by some key:

 1. given a text, count frequencies of words/characters;

    ```kotlin
    val frequencies = words.groupingBy { it }.eachCount()
    ```

 2. given orders in all stores, sum total value of orders by store;
    ```kotlin
    val storeTotals =
            orders.groupingBy { it.store }
                  .eachSumOf { order -> order.total }
    ```

 3. given orders of all clients, find an order with the maximum total for each client.
    ```kotlin
    val bestClientOrders =
            orders.groupingBy { it.client }
                  .reduce { k, maxValueOrder, order -> maxOfBy(order, maxValueOrder) { it.total } }
    ```

## Alternatives

* Just use `groupBy` and then `mapValues` on a resulting map.
    * Pro: many operations are supported on a group of values, not just `fold`.
    * Con: intermediate map of lists is created.

    Example:

    ```kotlin
    val frequencies: Map<String, Int> =
            words.groupBy { it }.mapValues { it.value.size }
    ```

* Use Rx.observables.
    * Pro: many operations supported
    * Con: observable transformations overhead,
    asymptotically less than that of `mapValues`.

    ```kotlin
    val frequencies: Map<String, Int> =
            Observable.from(values)
                    .groupBy { it }
                    .flatMap { g -> g.count().map { g.key to it } }
                    .toBlocking()
                    .toIterable()
                    .toMap()
    ```

* [Previous version of this proposal](https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/blob/f1cdce73b5c1983d9380d632d2fcdd73c6253c23/proposals/stdlib/group-and-fold.md)
intended to introduce fully inlined operations, such as `groupFoldBy(keySelector, initialValue, operation)`.
    * Pro: do not require a wrapper `Grouping` object to be allocated.
    * Pro: may require less intermediate boxing in case of receivers with primitive elements, such as primitive arrays and char sequences.
    * Con: having several functional parameters makes an invocation awkward.
    * Con: duplicating all the operations for each receiver type implies high method count.

    A benchmark was conducted to study the performance impact of not inlining `keySelector` function.
    That impact [was shown](https://github.com/ilya-g/kotlinx.collections.experimental/blob/master/kotlinx-collections-experimental/benchmarks/src/main/kotlin/results.txt)
    to be negligible for receivers with object elements,
    and on the other side noticeable for receivers with primitive elements.
    However, the latter is hardly to be the use case covered by this operation.

## Dependencies

Only a subset of Kotlin Standard Library available on all supported platforms is required.

## Placement

 - module: `kotlin-stdlib`
 - packages: `kotlin.collections`, `kotlin.sequences`, `kotlin.text`

## Reference implementation

The prototypes are implemented in the repository [kotlinx.collections.experimental](https://github.com/ilya-g/kotlinx.collections.experimental/tree/master/kotlinx-collections-experimental/src/main/kotlin/kotlinx.collections.experimental/grouping).

The final implementation has been merged into the standard library, here is the [commit set](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/compare/4816474~6...4816474).

### Receivers

It is possible to provide `groupingBy` operation for each collection-like receiver, such as
`Iterable`, `Sequence`, `Array`, `CharSequence`, `(Primitive)Array`,
however for primitive arrays this operation does not make much sense.

### Return type

The operation returns `Map<K, R>`, where `K` is the type of the key and `R` is the type of the accumulator.

## Questions

1. Naming options:
    * `groupingBy` or just `grouping`

        There is a risk of confusing `groupingBy` and `groupBy`.

    * `count`/`sumBy` can be misinterpreted as operations on the whole collection, rather on each group.
        * **resolution**: `countEach`, `sumEachBy`
        
    * `Grouping` is often referenced in docs as "grouping source", so maybe we should name it `GroupingSource`?

2. Which general forms of `fold`/`reduce`/`aggregate` should we provide?
    * Method count is increased
        * **resolution**: since there's a single receiver for all operations, the impact on method count is not that big.
    * Having them as overloads hurts completion during gradual typing.
3. Should we provide `To`-overloads (like `groupByTo`) with a mutable map as a target parameter?
    * **resolution**: there are no easy alternatives to achieve the same results without these overloads,
     so we should provide them.
     
4. Having primitive fold accumulators stored in a map introduces a lot of boxing.
    * **resolution**: provide optimized implementations of `countEach` and `sumEachBy`. 
    Note that, there's no such optimization for `countEachTo` and `sumEachByTo`.
    
5. Should we provide `sumEachByLong` and `sumEachByDouble` operations, 
or wait until [KT-11265](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-11265) is resolved, 
so we could have them as overloads of `eachSumOf`?
    * **resolution**: provide them as overloads of `eachSumOf`, 
    but do not provide `eachSumOf` itself until KT-11265 is fixed. 

## Future advancements

* If we do not provide some forms, evaluate whether they could be introduced later.
* Converting collection operations to folds can be error-prone, maybe we should provide
  some standard reducer functions, such as Count, Sum etc.
* In Java 8 it is possible to engage standard Collectors API by providing the operation
  `Grouping<T, K>.collectEach(Collector<T, A, R>)`
