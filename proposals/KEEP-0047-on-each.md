# Add function for peeking into Sequences and Iterables

* **Type**: Standard Library API proposal
* **Author**: Christian Br√ºggemann
* **Status**: Implemented in Kotlin 1.1
* **Prototype**: Implemented
* **Related issues**: [KT-8220](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-8220)
* **Discussion**: [KEEP-47](https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/issues/47)


## Summary

The goal is to introduce a function called `onEach`, which allows the user to perform an action on each element of a `Sequence` or an `Iterable` without breaking the functional chain like `forEach` does.

## Description

When working with `Sequences` or `Iterables`, it can be useful to take a look at what items are passed through the stream. This is especially useful for debugging. Effectively, `onEach` would work like this:

```kotlin
fun <T> Sequence<T>.onEach(f: (T) -> Unit): Sequence<T> = map { f(it); it }
// the following signatures are similified, look for actual ones in the prototype
inline fun <T> Iterable<T>.onEach(f: (T) -> Unit): Iterable<T> = apply { forEach(f) }
inline fun <K, V> Map<out K, V>.onEach(action: (Map.Entry<K, V>) -> Unit)
inline fun CharSequence.onEach(action: (Char) -> Unit)
```

However, `onEach` could also be implemented without relying on `map` by implementing a custom `Sequence`/`Iterator` which allows for peeking.

### Example usage

```
val sum = listOf(1, 2, 3).asSequence().onEach { println("Adding $it") }.sum()
```

### Naming

As described in the related [YouTrack issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-8220#tab=Comments), the name `peek` could be confused with `Queue.peek`. Thus, the following alternatives was considered to mitigate this:

* onEach
* peekEach
* doOnEach

Overall, `onEach` was chosen to reflect similarity with `forEach`.

## Similar API review

* Java `Streams` have `peek` ([docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html#peek-java.util.function.Consumer-)) as well.
* RxJava contains a method called `doOnNext` ([docs](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/do.html))

## Use cases
For debugging (the strongest use case):
```kotlin
inputDir.walk()
    .filter { it.isFile && it.name.endsWith(".txt") }
    .peek { println("Moving $it to $outputDir") }
    .forEach { moveFile(it, File(outputDir, it.toRelativeString(inputDir))) }
```
For various intermediate operations, real-world example from a distributed hashtable:
```kotlin
internalMap.entrySet().stream()
		.filter(entryBelongsToNeighbor(newNeighbor))
		.peek(entry -> newNeighbor.send(new AckPutMessage<>(this, entry.getKey(), entry.getValue())))
		.map(Map.Entry::getKey)
		.forEach(key -> System.out.println("Moving key " + toProperKey(key) + " to neighbor " + newNeighbor.id()));
```

* The lambda passed to `peek` is a good place to set breakpoints
* Perhaps more due to equivalent methods in Java 8 and RxJava, though it is hard to find examples where `peek` was not used for debugging (for instance `println` or using a logging method). Here are some from RxJava (`doOnNext`):

## Alternatives

- use `apply { forEach { } }` for collections, and roughly `map { apply { } }` for sequences.

## Dependencies

Only the stdlib.

## Placement

* Standard Library
* package: kotlin.sequences in file [Sequences.kt](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/master/libraries/stdlib/src/kotlin/collections/Sequences.kt)

## Reference implementation

The final implementation has been merged into the standard library, here is the [commit set](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/compare/dc57d69~2...dc57d69).

## Unresolved questions

* Which name should be picked?
    - settled on `onEach`
* Should `onEach` delegate to `map`/`forEach` or be implemented using a custom `Sequence`/`Iterator`?
    - `onEach` for sequences should delegate to `map` to reuse its possible optimizations.
