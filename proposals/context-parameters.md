## Declarations with context parameters

**§1.1** *(declaration)*: Function and property declarations get support for **context parameters**. Context parameters are declared with the `context` keyword followed by a list of parameters, each of the form `name: Type`.

* Constructors may **not** declare context parameters.
* Context parameters are allowed in operators, except for those related to [property delegation](https://kotlinlang.org/spec/declarations.html#delegated-property-declaration).
* Within the body of the declaration, the value of the context parameter is accessible using its name, similar to value parameters.
* It is allowed to use `_` as a name; in that case, the value is not accessible through any name (but still participates in context resolution).

```kotlin
interface Type {
  context(analysisScope: AnalysisScope)
  val isNullable: Boolean = ...
}

context(analysisScope: AnalysisScope)
fun Type.equalTo(other: Type): Boolean = ...

context(_: AnalysisScope)
val Type.isBoolean: Boolean get() = this.equalTo(BuiltIns.Boolean)
```

**§1.2** *(restrictions)*:

* It is an *error* to declare an **empty** list of context parameters.
* It is an *error* if the **name** of a context parameter **coincides** with the name of another context or value parameter to the callable (except for multiple uses of `_`).

**§1.3** *(properties)*: As mentioned in §1.1, properties may declare context parameters. Those context parameters should be understood of the property "as a whole".

```kotlin
context(users: UserRepository)
val firstUser: User? get() = users.getById(1)
```

Properties declared with context parameters have [**no** _backing field_](https://kotlinlang.org/spec/declarations.html#getters-and-setters). In turn, that means that they may **not** declare an _initializer_. The underlying reason is that the value for the context parameter is not available until the property is accessed, and may change according to the context.

```kotlin
// not allowed (property with initializer)
context(_: AnalysisScope)
val Type.isBoolean: Boolean = this.equalTo(BuiltIns.Boolean)
```

It is **not** possible to declare context parameters solely for the getter or setter. It is unclear how a property reference should behave if the set of context parameters differs between the getter and the setter.

At this point, properties with context parameters may **not** use [_delegation_](https://kotlinlang.org/spec/declarations.html#delegated-property-declaration). It is unclear at this point what should be the correct semantics for such a declaration.

**§1.4** *(implicitness)*: When calling a function or property with context parameters, those are not spelled out. Rather, the value for each of those arguments is **resolved** from two sources: in-scope context parameters, and implicit receivers ([as defined by the Kotlin specification](https://kotlinlang.org/spec/overload-resolution.html#receivers)). We say that context parameters are **implicit**.

```kotlin
context(logger: Logger) fun logWithTime(message: String) =
  logger.log("${LocalDateTime.now()}: $message")

context(logger: Logger) fun User.doAction() {
  logWithTime("saving user $id")
  // ...
}
```

**§1.5** *(override and overloading)*: Context parameters are part of the signature, and follow the same rules as regular value parameters concerning overriding:

* The type and order of context parameters must coincide.
* It is allowed (yet discouraged) to change the name of a context parameter.

It is a conflict to declare overloads which only differ in the number of context parameters. It is allowed to declare one overload with _no_ context parameters and one with _some_ of them (this is aligned with §7.8).

**§1.6** *(naming ambiguity)*: We use the term **context** with two meanings:

1. For a declaration, it refers to the collection of context parameters declared in its signature. We also use the term *contextual function or property*.
2. Within a block, we use context to refer to the combination of implicit receivers and context parameters in scope in that block. This context is the source for context resolution, that is, for "filling in" the implicit context parameters.

**§1.7** *(function types)*: **Function types** are extended with context parameters. It is only allowed to mention the *type* of context parameters, names are not supported.

* We do not want to inspect the body of a lambda looking for different context parameter names during overload resolution. The reasoning is similar to how we restrict lambdas with no declared arguments to be 0 or 1-ary.

```kotlin
context(Transaction) (UserId) -> User?
context(Logger) User.() -> Int
```

Note that, like in the case of extension receivers, those types are [considered equivalent (for typing purposes, **not** for resolution purposes)](https://kotlinlang.org/spec/type-system.html#function-types) to the function types in which all parameters are declared as value parameters _in the same order_.

```kotlin
// these are all equivalent types
context(Logger, User) () -> Int
context(Logger) User.() -> Int
context(Logger) (User) -> Int
Logger.(User) -> Int
(Logger, User) -> Int
```

As a result of these equivalences, it is possible invoke a value with a function type with context parameters by giving them as regular value parameters.

```kotlin
fun foo(x: context(String, Double) Int.(z: Long) -> Unit, y: Int) {
    context("", 1.0) {
        y.x(1L)       // OK, regular way to call it
    }

    y.x("", 1.0, 1L)  // NO
    x("", 1.0, y, 1L) // OK, all parameters as values
}
```

It is not allowed to pass context arguments explicitly inside a value argument list when callee is a regular function (not a value of a function type).

```kotlin
context(_: String, _: Double) fun Int.x(z: Long): Unit { }

fun foo(y: Int) {
    context("", 1.0) {
        y.x(1L)       // regular way to call it
    }

    y.x("", 1.0, 1L)  // NO
    x("", 1.0, y, 1L) // NO
}
```

**§1.8** *(lambdas)*: If a lambda is assigned a function type with context parameters, those behave as if declared with `_` as its name.

* They participate in context resolution but are only accessible through the `implicit` function (defined below).

```kotlin
fun <A> withConsoleLogger(block: context(Logger) () -> A) = ...

withConsoleLogger {
  // you can call functions with Logger as context parameter
  logWithTime("doing something")
  // you can use 'implicit' to access the context parameter
  implicit<Logger>().log("hello")
}
```

## Standard library support

**§2.1** *(`context` function)*: The `context` function adds a new value to the context, in an anonymous manner.

* The implementation may be built into the compiler, instead of having a plethora of functions defined in the standard library.
* Implementations are encouraged, but not required, to mark these functions as `inline`.

```kotlin
fun <A, R> context(context: A, block: context(A) () -> R): R = block(context)
fun <A, B, R> context(a: A, b: B, block: context(A, B) () -> R): R = block(a, b)
fun <A, B, C, R> context(a: A, b: B, c: C, block: context(A, B, C) () -> R): R = block(a, b, c)
```

**§2.2** *(`contextOf` function)*: We also provide a generic way to obtain a value by type from the context. It allows access to context parameters even when declared using `_`, or within the body of a lambda.

* Implementations are encouraged, but not required, to mark this function as `inline`.
* If possible, type inference for type variable `A` should be restricted (for example, using `@NoInfer`). Developers are expected to use the function with explicit type arguments. 

```kotlin
context(ctx: A) fun <A> contextOf(): A = ctx
```

_Note:_ This function replaces the uses of `this@Type` in the previous iteration of the design.

### Reflection

**§2.3** *(callable references)*: As described in the corresponding section below, callable references eagerly resolve all the context parameters, so no changes are needed to the API when working with those.

```kotlin
context(users: UserService) val User.name: String = ...

context(users: UserService) fun doSomething() {
  val nameProperty = User::name
  // type is KProperty1<User, String>
  // the context 'users' is already resolved in the reference
}
```

The following two paragraphs describe the extensions required when contextual declarations are accessed via [reflection](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reflection.html); usually via the [`kotlin.reflect` package](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.reflect/). For example, when using the `declaredMembers` property from a `KClass`.

**§2.4** *(callable reflection)*: We extend the `kotlin.reflect` API to with information about context parameters.

```kotlin
interface KParameter {
  enum class Kind { 
    INSTANCE, EXTENSION_RECEIVER, VALUE, 
    CONTEXT_PARAMETER // new
  }
}

val KCallable<*>.contextParameters: List<KParameter>
  get() = parameters.filter { 
    it.kind == KParameter.Kind.CONTEXT_PARAMETER
  }

```

**§2.5** *(property reflection)*: Properties with context parameters are represented as extending `KProperty` and also the function type corresponding to their getter. At this point, we do not extend the hierarchy of `KProperty0/1/2` to account for the additional context parameters.

## Simulating receivers

There are cases where the need to refer to members of a context parameter through its name may hurt readability — this happens mostly in relation to DSLs. In this section, we provide guidance on how to solve this issue.

**§3.1** *(bridge function)*: Given an interface with some members,

```kotlin
interface Raise<in Error> {
  fun raise(error: Error): Nothing
}
```

the authors of the API want to let users call `raise` whenever `Raise<E>` is in scope, without having to mention the context parameter, but ensuring that the corresponding value is part of the context.

```kotlin
context(_: Raise<E>) fun <E, A> Either<E, A>.bind(): A =
  when (this) {
    is Left  -> raise(error)  // instead of r.raise
    is Right -> value
  }
```

They can do this by introducing a **bridge function** at top level that simply wraps the access to the context parameter.

```kotlin
context(r: Raise<E>) fun raise(error: Error): Nothing = r.raise(error)
```

**§3.2** *(receiver migration, members)*: If a library exposes a "scope" or "context" type, we suggest reworking the API to use context parameters:

1. functions with the scope type as extension receiver should be refactored to use context parameters,
2. operations defined as members and extending other types should be taken out of the interface definition, if possible,
3. operations defined as members of the scope type should be exposed additionally with bridge functions.

*How do you know that your type `S` is of such kind?*

* It's often used as extension receiver, but without being the "subject" of the action.
* There's some "run" function that takes a `S.() → R` function as an argument.

```kotlin
fun <E> Raise<E>.foo() = ...
// should become
context(_: Raise<E>) fun <E> foo() = ...

interface Raise<in Error> {
  fun <A> Either<Error, A>.bind() = ...
}
// this function can be exposed now as follows
context(_: Raise<E>) fun <E, A> Either<E, A>.bind() = ...
```

**§3.3** *(receiver migration, run functions)*: We advise keeping any function taking a lambda where the scope type appears as extension receiver as is, and provide a new variant with a context parameter. The latter must unfortunately get a different name to prevent overload conflicts.

```kotlin
fun <E, A> runRaise(block: Raise<E>.() -> A): Either<E, A>
// provide the additional variant
fun <E, A> runRaiseContext(block: context(Raise<E>) () -> A): Either<E, A>
```

**§3.4** *(receiver migration, source compatibility)*: The rules above guarantee source compatibility for users of the interface.

## Use cases

This is a recollection and categorization of the different use cases we have found for context parameters, including guidelines on which kind of parameter is more applicable (if so).

### As implicits

**§4.1** *(implicit use case)*: In this case, the context parameter is thought of as a set of services available to a piece of code, but without the ceremony of passing those services explicitly in every call. In most cases, those contexts are introduced with an explicit name.

A `Repository` class for a particular entity or a `Logger` are good examples of this mode of use.

```kotlin
context(users: UserRepository) fun User.getFriends() = ...
```

### As scopes

**§4.2** *(scope use case)*: In this case we use the context parameter as a marker of being inside a particular scope, which unlocks additional abilities. A prime example is `CoroutineScope`, which adds `launch`, `async`, and so on. In this mode of use:

* The `Scope` type is carefully designed, and the functions are exposed using bridge functions,
* In most cases, the context parameter has no name or is irrelevant.

This covers other types of scopes as `Transaction`, or `Resource`-related. The `Raise` and `ResourceScope` DSLs from the Arrow project also fit this view.

```kotlin
// currently uses extension receivers
fun ResourceScope.openFile(file: File): InputStream
// but the API is nicer using context parameters
context(_: ResourceScope) fun File.open(): InputStream
```

### For extending DSLs

**§4.3.1** *(DSLs use case)*: In this case, contexts are used to provide new members available in a domain-specific language. Currently, this is approached by declaring an interface that represents the "DSL context", and then having member or extension functions on that interface.

```kotlin
interface HtmlScope {
  fun body(block: HtmlScope.() -> Unit)
}
```

Context parameters lift two of the main restrictions of this mode of use:

* It's possible to add new members with an extension receiver without modifying the Scope class itself.
* It's possible to add members which are only available when the DSL Scope has certain type arguments.

**§4.3.2** *(`DslMarker`)*: we strive to make `@DslMarker` annotations work uniformly across receivers and context parameters, as described in §7.7.

### Context-oriented dispatch / externally-implemented interface / type classes

**§4.4** *(context-oriented dispatch use case)*: Context parameters can be used to simulate functions available for a type, by requiring an interface that uses the type as an argument. This is very similar to type classes in other languages.

```kotlin
interface ToJson<T> {
  fun toJson(thing: T): Json
}

context(serializer: ToJson<T>) fun <T> T.toJson(): Json =
  serializer.toJson(this)

context(_: ToJson<T>) fun <T> ApplicationCall.json(thing: T) =
  this.respondJson(thing.toJson())
```

We strongly advise _against_ creating "copies" of an API but with an added context parameter.
Overload resolution is tricky, and the developer may end up calling the unintended version.

```kotlin
interface Comparator<T> {
  fun compareTo(one: T, other: T): Boolean
}

context(comparator: Comparator<T>) fun <T> T.compareTo(other: T): Boolean =
  comparator.compareTo(one, other)

context(_: Comparator<T>) fun <T> max(x: T, y: T) =
  if (x.compareTo(y) > 0) x else y
```

### Dependency injection

**§4.5.1** *(dependency injection use case)*: You can view context parameters as values that must be "injected" from the context for the code to work. Since context arguments are completely resolved at compile-time, this provides something like dependency injection in the language.

**§4.5.2** *(dependency injection use case, companion object)*: In some cases, you may want to define that instantiating a certain class requires some value — this creates the typical hierarchy of dependency we see in DI frameworks. We can accomplish this by faking a constructor with those contexts:

```kotlin
interface Logger { ... }
interface UserService { ... }

class DbUserService(val logger: Logger, val connection: DbConnection): UserService {
  companion object {
    context(logger: Logger, connection: DbConnection)
    operator fun invoke(): DbUserService = DbUserService(logger, connection)
  }
}
```

**§4.5.3** *(dependency injection use case, discouragement)*: Note that we suggest against this feature, since having parameters explicitly reduces the need to nest too many `context` calls.

```kotlin
// do not do this
context(ConsoleLogger(), DbConnectionPool(2)) {
  context(DbUserService()) {
    ...
  }
}

// better be explicit about object creation
val logger = ConsoleLogger()
val pool = DbConnectionPool(2)
val userService = DbUserService(logger, pool)
// and then inject everything you need in one go
context(logger, userService) {
   ...
}
```

## Callable references

**§5.1** *(callable references, eager resolution)*: References to callables declared with context parameters are resolved **eagerly**:

* The required context parameters must be resolved in the context in which the reference is created,
* The resulting type does not mention context.

```kotlin
class User
val user = User()

context(users: UserService) fun User.doStuff(x: Int): Int = x + 1

// val x = User::doStuff  // unresolved
// val y = user::doStuff  // unresolved

context(users: UserService) fun example() {
    val g = User::doStuff  // resolve context, g: User.() -> Int
                           // you need to explicitly write the lambda below
    val h: context(UserService) User.() -> Int = { doStuff() }
}
```

**§5.2** *(callable references, motivation)*: This design was motivated by the pattern of having a set of functions sharing a common context parameter, like in the example below.

```kotlin
context(users: UserService) fun save(u: User): Unit { ... }
context(users: UserService) fun saveAll(users: List<User>): Unit = 
  users.forEach(::save) // ::save is resolved as (User) -> Unit
```

**§5.3** *(callable references, equality)*: Captured context parameters should be treated in the same way as captured receivers for the purposes of function equality and hashing.

**§5.4** *(callable references, future)*: We consider as **future** improvement a more complex resolution of callables, in which the context is taken into account when the callable is used as an argument of a function that expects a function type with context.

## Context and classes

**§6.1** *(no contexts in constructors)*: We do **not** support context parameters in constructor declarations (neither primary nor secondary). There are some issues around their design, especially when mixed with inheritance and private/protected visibility.

**§6.2** *(no contexts in constructors, workaround)*: Note that Kotlin is very restrictive with constructors, as it doesn't allow them to be `suspend` either; the same workarounds (companion object + `invoke`, function with the name of the class) are available in this case.

**§6.3** *(no contexts in constructors, future)*: We have defined levels of increasing support for contexts in classes, which steer how the feature may evolve:

1. No context for constructors (current one),
2. Contexts only for secondary constructors,
3. Contexts also in primary constructors, but without the ability to write `val`/`var` in front of them,
4. Support for `val`/`var` for context parameter, but without entering the context,
5. Context parameters declared with `val`/`var` enter the context of every declaration.

**§6.4** *(no contexts in class declarations)*: At this point, we include no "context in class" feature, which would both add a context parameter to the constructor and make that value available implicitly in the body of the class. We've explored some possibilities, but the conclusion was that we do not know at this point which is the right one.

In the code above we show a piece of code not allowed by the current design, and two different ways we can provide a similar behavior using constructs that are available.

```kotlin
// this was allowed in the previous iteration
context(AnalysisScope) class TypeScope {
  fun Type.equalTo(other: Type): Boolean = ...
}

// possibility 1: scope stored once for the entire lifetime of an instance
class TypeScope(val analysisScope: AnalysisScope) {
  fun Type.equalTo(other: Type): Boolean = ...
}

// possibility 2: scope required on each operation
class TypeScope {
  context(analysisScope: AnalysisScope)
  fun Type.equalTo(other: Type): Boolean = ...
}
```

Furthermore, we think that "scoped properties" may bring a better overall solution to this problem; and adding this feature now would get in the way.

## Technical design

### Syntax

**§7.1** *(`context` is a modifier)*: Everybody's favorite topic! Although the current implementation places some restrictions on the location of the context block, the intention is to turn it (syntactically) into a modifier. In terms of the Kotlin grammar,

```
functionModifier: ... | context
propertyModifier: ... | context

context: 'context' '(' parameter { ',' parameter } [ ',' ] ')'

functionType: [ functionContext ] [ receiverType '.' ] ...
functionContext: 'context' '(' receiverType { ',' receiverType } [ ',' ] ')'
```

Context parameters may receive annotations as any other regular parameter.

```kotlin
context(@Annotated users: UserRepository) fun foo() = ...
```

**Recommended style:** annotations, context parameters, then other modifiers as per the [usual style guide](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html#modifiers-order).

**§7.2** *(disambiguating `context`)*: We do not enforce `context` as a hard keyword, leading to potential ambiguities in the body of declarations. In particular, `context(` may be both the beginning of:

1. A call to a function named `context`,
2. The context parameter list of a local declaration.

The compiler should perform a lookahead of two additional tokens to disambiguate:

- If the opening parenthesis is followed by an identifier and a ':', then it should be treated as the beginning of a local declaration.
- Otherwise, it should be treated as the beginning of a function call.

### Extended resolution algorithm

**§7.3** *(declaration with context parameters)*: The context parameters declared for a callable are available in the same way as "regular" value parameters in the body of the function. Both value and context parameters are introduced in the same scope, there is no shadowing between them (remember that parameters names must be unique across both value and context parameters),

**§7.4** *(applicability, lambdas)*: Building the constraint system is modified for lambda arguments. Compared with the [Kotlin specification](https://kotlinlang.org/spec/overload-resolution.html#description), the type of the parameter _U<sub>m</sub>_ is replaced with _nocontext(U<sub>m</sub>)_, where _nocontext_ removes the initial `context` block from the function type.

**§7.5** *(applicability, context resolution)*: After the first phase of function applicability -- checking the type constraint problem -- an additional **context resolution** phase is inserted. For each potentially applicable callable, for each context parameter, we traverse the tower of scopes looking for **exactly one** default receiver or context parameter with a compatible type.

If a type of a declared context parameter of a candidate uses a **generic type** whose value is not determined yet, then the corresponding type constraints are added to the constraint system of this candidate call. If solving this system fails, then the candidate is considered to be inapplicable, without trying to substitute different implicit receivers available in the context.

There are three possible outcomes of this process:

1. If _no_ compatible context value is found for at least one context parameter, then the call is _not_ applicable, and it is removed from the candidate set as a result.
2. If for at least one context parameter there is more than one compatible value at the same level (and case 1 does not apply), a _context ambiguity_ error is issued.
3. If none of (1) or (2) apply, then the candidate is applicable.

The following piece of code exemplifies how scoping interacts with context resolution:

```kotlin
interface Logger {
  fun log(message: String)
}
class ConsoleLogger: Logger { ... }
class FileLogger: Logger { ... }

context(logger: Logger) fun logWithTime(message: String) = ...

context(console: ConsoleLogger, file: FileLogger) fun example1() =
  logWithTime("hello")  // ambiguity error
  
context(file: FileLogger) fun example2() = 
  context(ConsoleLogger()) { 
    logWithTime("hello")  // no ambiguity, uses the new ConsoleLogger
  }

context(console: ConsoleLogger, file: FileLogger) fun example3() =
  context(console) { logWithTime("hello") }  // no ambiguity, uses 'console'

context(console: ConsoleLogger, file: FileLogger) fun example4() =
  with(console) { logWithTime("hello") }  // no ambiguity, uses 'console'
```

**§7.6** *(context resolution, smart casting)*: During context resolution any smart cast over available contexts should be considered. For example, the following code should be accepted:

```kotlin
context(ctx: Any) fun foo() {
  if (ctx is String) bar()
}

context(s: String) fun bar() { }
```

**§7.7** *(applicability, `DslMarker`)*: we say that a value is `X`-DSL-marked if the type of that value is annotated with `@X`, and `X` is itself annotated with [`@DslMarker`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-dsl-marker/).

If at a certain scope there is a potential contextual `X`-DSL-marked value in scope (either coming from a context parameter or from an implicit receiver) and context resolution chooses a contextual `X`-DSL-marked value in an outer scope, it is a compilation _error_.

This is in addition to the _old rule_, stating: if at a certain scope there is an implicit `X`-DSL-marked receiver in scope and resolution chooses a `X`-DSL-marked implicit receiver in an outer scope, it is a compilation error. Note that context parameters do _not_ conflict with implicit receivers when the latter are used as receivers.

These rules extend the [usual behavior of `@DslMarker`](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/type-safe-builders.html#scope-control-dslmarker) to cover both receivers and context parameters uniformly.

```kotlin
@DslMarker annotation class ExampleMarker

@ExampleMarker interface ExampleScope<A> {
  fun exemplify(): A
}

fun <A, T> withExampleReceiver(value: A, block: ExampleScope<A>.() -> T): T = ...
fun <A, T> withExampleContext(value: A, block: context(example: ExampleScope<A>) () -> T): T =
  withExampleReceiver(value) { block() }

context(ExampleScope<A>) fun <A> similarExampleTo(other: A): A = ...

fun dslMarkerExample() =
  withExampleContext(3) { // (1)
    withExampleReceiver("b") { // (2)
      // at this point you can only use
      // the ExampleScope introduced (2)
      // to resolve context parameters

      similarExampleTo("hello") // correct, uses (2)
      similarExampleTo(1) // rejected: DSL scope violation
                          // since it resolved to (1)

      withExampleContext(true) { // (3)
        // at this point you can only use
        // the ExampleScope introduced (3)
        // to resolve context parameters

        this.exemplify()  // correct, uses (2)
                          // (1) and (3) may not be receivers
        similarExampleTo("bye")  // rejected: DSL scope violation
      }
    }
  }
```

**§7.8** *(most specific candidate)*: When choosing the **most specific candidate** we follow the [Kotlin specification](https://kotlinlang.org/spec/overload-resolution.html#choosing-the-most-specific-candidate-from-the-overload-candidate-set), with one addition:

* Candidates with context parameters are considered more specific than those without them.
* But there is no other prioritization coming from the length of the context parameter list or their types.

For example, the following call to `foo` is declared ambiguous, since `"hello"` may work both as `String` or `Any` context parameter.

```kotlin
context(Any) fun foo() {}
context(String) fun foo() {}

fun test() = with("hello") {
    foo()
}

The reasoning for this particular rule is that, since contexts are implicit, there is no way for the user to resolve to the other function if required. This implicitness also means that it's harder to figure out which overload is called from the program code -- once again, there's no value you can easily point to. In contrast, in the case of an explicit parameter, you can always use `f("hello" as Any)` to force using `(Any) -> R` over `(String) -> R`.

### Extended type inference algorithm

**§7.9** *(lambda literal inference)*: the type inference process in the [Kotlin specification](https://kotlinlang.org/spec/type-inference.html#statements-with-lambda-literals) should take context parameters into account. Note that unless a function type with context is "pushed" as a type for the lambda, context parameters are never inferred.

Context parameters take part in [builder-style type inference](https://kotlinlang.org/spec/type-inference.html#builder-style-type-inference), or any similar process defined by the implementation and whose goal is to infer better types for receivers.

### ABI compatibility

**§7.10** *(JVM and Java compatibility, functions)*: In the JVM a function with context parameters is represented as a function with additional parameters. In particular, the order is:
1. Context parameters, if present;
2. Extension receiver, if present;
3. Regular value parameters.

Note that parameter names do not impact JVM ABI compatibility, but we use the names given in parameter declarations as far as possible.

**§7.11** *(JVM and Java compatibility, properties)*: In the JVM a property with context parameters is represented by its corresponding getter and/or setter. This representation follows the same argument order described in §7.10.

**§7.12** *(other targets)*: Targets may not follow the same ABI compatibility guarantees as those described for the JVM.

## Q&A about design decisions

*Q: Why drop context receivers?*

One of the main objections to the previous design was the potential scope pollution:

- Having too many functions available in scope without qualification makes it difficult to find the right one;
- It becomes much harder to establish where a certain member is coming from.

We think that context parameters provide a better first step in understanding how implicit context resolution fits in Kotlin, without that caveat.

*Q: Why do callable references resolve differently with context parameters and extension receivers?*

We've considered five different designs; these are the reasons we've decided for the described one.

* Even though extension (and dispatch) receivers are implicit in function calls, they are explicit in callable references — think of `User::save`. This is not the case for context parameters.
* We found the use case of passing a reference to a function such `map`, while reusing the context from the outer declaration, a quite important one.

Note that we intend to improve our design to account for additional cases in which this rule fails, but taking the context parameters succeeds. However, this is part of a larger process of function conversions, in which we also want to consider similar behavior for suspend, composable, and other modifiers.

*Q: Why drop the subtyping restriction between context receivers?*

One important piece of feedback in the previous design was the need for functions that introduce more than one value in the context. In turn, that means providing a function such as the following.

```kotlin
fun <A, B, R> context(a: A, b: B, block: context(A, B) () -> R): R
```

The subtyping restriction would disallow this case, since `A` and `B` may (potentially) be subtypes of one another. We've considered adding some sort of additional restrictions at the type level or making this function a built-in, but in the end, we've decided that it's the developer's responsibility to keep a clean and ordered context. An ambiguity error seems reasonable if the problem arises at the use site.

*Q: Why drop the context-in-class feature altogether?*

As we explored the design, we concluded that the interplay between contexts and inheritance and visibility is quite complex. Think of questions such as whether a context parameter to a class should also be in the context of an extension method to that class, and whether that should depend on the potential visibility of such context parameter. At this point, we think that a good answer would only come if we fully design "`with` properties", that is, values that also enter the context scope in their block.

An additional stone in the way is that one commonly requested use case is to have a constructor with value parameters and another where some of those are contextual. However, this leads to platform clashes, so we would need an additional design on that part.
